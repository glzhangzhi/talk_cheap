# Workshops, Furniture, and Stairs

# 工坊，家具和椅子

Lets continue on with our exciting and fascinating Dwarf Fortress Walkthrough! In this section we’ll work on getting some workshops set up and we’ll dig out a lot more space for our shorties. There’s lots to do, so lets get cracking!

让我们继续我们令人兴奋的DF教程！在这一节中我们会建立一些工坊并在我们的小天地里挖掘更多的空间。这里面有太多的工作了，所以让我们一步步来。

## 2.1. Building a Workshop

## 2.1 建立一个工坊

Workshops are a central feature of DF so lets get to grips with them right away. Workshops are places your dwarfs work, usually turning base materials into useful goods. The list of workshops can be a little overwhelming (b then w), but don’t worry, we only need to worry about a couple early on.

工坊是DF的一个核心功能，所以让我们现在来掌握它。工坊是你的矮人们工作的地方，通常矮人们会在这里把基础的原材料转变成有用的东西。工坊的列表（按b键然后按w键）长度也许会吓到你，但不要担心，我们前期只需要关心其中的一小部分。

First up we need a carpenter’s workshop, this workshop allows us to turn wood logs into furniture and other items. You should see a lot of wood scattered around in front of the fort, where the wood cutter has left it after felling trees. We have no wood pile for it to be moved to, you see.

首先我们需要一个木匠工坊，这个工坊能够让我们将原木变成家具或其他东西。你应该可以看到在大门前堆放了很多木材，伐木工们在砍倒树木后将原木堆放在了那里。我们现在并没有一个对应的木材仓库。

Ideally, we’d like to build the carpenter’s workshop inside, but we haven’t dug a nice enough space for the workshop yet, so lets chuck it outside for now:

理想状态下，我们更乐意在室内建立一个木匠工坊，但我们还没有挖出一个好的空间来设置木匠工坊，所以目前我们就将它设置在室外：

- Move the view to the front of the fortress.
- 将视角移动到要塞门前
- Hit b for Building, and then w for Workshops. You can also just scroll down to Workshops using = and hit Enter.
- 按b键进入建筑菜单，然后按w键进入工坊菜单。你能使用=键向下滚动选择工坊然后按回车键
- You will now see a list of workshops. It scrolls off the bottom of the page (scroll around if you like)! Hit c for Carpenters workshop.
- 你会看到一系列工坊，这个列表的长度已经超出的屏幕的长度（如果你喜欢你可以滚动列表四处看看）！按c键选择木匠工坊
- The menu will vanish and the placement menu will appear. The green X’s mark out the workshop’s footprint. The dark green Xs are squares that will be impassible once the workshop is built, keep this in mind when building in an enclosed space, you don’t want to block the door!
- 菜单这时会消失，然后出现一个放置菜单。绿色的X记号指示出了工坊将建造的位置。暗绿色的X记号意味着在这些方块位置在工坊被建造后将无法通过，这对于你之后在室内建造时很重要，你不会希望你的工坊阻挡你的门

![../_images/02-carpenter-place.png](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/02-carpenter-place.png)

- Chose a spot in front of the fortress. Somewhere around where mine is marked should do. Once you’re ready to place your workshop hit Enter.
- 在要塞门口选择一块地方。在我标记的位置周围应该都是可行的。在你选择好之后按下回车键
- The menu on the right will now change to a list of items you could use to build the workshop with. Mostly it will be a list of wood and it will look something like this:
- 右方的菜单现在会变成一个列表，你能在这个列表中选择用什么来建造这个工坊。通常它会出现一列表的木头，它看起来和这样类似：

![../_images/02-carpenter-material.png](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/02-carpenter-material.png)

- At this point you could just hit enter and the first item on the list will be used to build the workshop. Instead, for fun, hit x and Expand the view to show a list of every single item the workshop can be built from. Expanding the item selection is a nice way to chose exactly the item you want to be used. Most of the time you can ignore this option, but it will come in handy later on.
- 这时你可以只是按下回车键，列表中的第一样材料会被用来建造工坊。当然，你可以为了好玩，你也可以按x键来将这个菜单扩展，你可以从这个扩展菜单中看见所用能被用来建造工坊的材料。扩展物品选择是一个来选择你想使用的物品的好方法。大多数时候你可以忽略这个选项，但之后我们会用到它
- Close the expanded menu with x again. For your interest note that items are sorted by distance from the workshop’s current location. Usually you want to build with the closest items to save your dwarfs a slow walk.
- 用x键关闭扩展菜单。你可以注意到这些物品是按照距离从近到远来排列的。通常你考虑到矮人们慢吞吞的步子你会想要使用距离最近的物品
- Once you’ve hit enter (selecting the building material) the workshop will be placed in an un-built state on the map. It will look like this:
- 一旦你按下回车键（选择了建筑用的材料）你的工坊会被以为建造的状态被放置在地图上。它看起来想这样：

![../_images/02-carpenter-template.png](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/02-carpenter-template.png)

Your workshop is now about to be built. You will have to hit Esc a couple of times to un-pause the game, but as soon as you do I bet you that a helpful wee dwarf will run over and start building it. If you’re quick you can hit q and see the status of the workshop, it should say Construction initiated..

你的工坊现在就要被建造了。按几次ESC键来让游戏恢复运行，很快你就能看到一个小矮人会跑过来然后开始建造。如果你足够快，你可以按q键来查看工坊的状态，它现在应该是建筑已初始化

A few seconds later, the workshop is built!

几秒钟之后，工坊就会被建好

![../_images/02-carpenter-built.png](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/02-carpenter-built.png)

It doesn’t look like much, but it’s really useful! I promise! So lets get turning some of this lumber into stuff our dwarfs can use. Just don’t tell the Elves, ok? They really hate us chopping down trees. Pointy-eared gits, a magma-steam death is too good for them!

虽然长的不像，但它真的是很有用的一个建筑。现在来让我们将木材变成我们矮人可以使用的东西。别和精灵们说这些好吗？他们真的很讨厌我们砍树。这些尖耳朵的混蛋，丢进熔岩里的死亡方式对他们来说真是太便宜他们了！

## 2.2. Making beds

## 2.2 制作床

Dwarfs don’t like sleeping in the dirt, they like nice, comfy beds - and solid gold statues in their bedrooms, but those will come later.

矮人们不喜欢睡在地上，他们喜欢柔软舒服的床，还有装饰得金碧辉煌的卧室，这些之后会有的。

Follow along with me:

跟随我按照以下步骤：

- Hit q and move the cursor over the carpentry workshop.
- 按q键然后移动光标到木工工坊上
- The menu on the right now shows you the actions you can take, specifically, we’re interested in a Add new task.
- 右方的菜单向你展示了你可以执行的操作，现在我们要做的是增加一个任务
- Hit a (duh)!
- 按a键
- Note the right menu is now a large list of stuff we can make. We’re after beds.
- 现在右边菜单会变成你能够制作的一大列物品，我们在其中寻找床。
- You can scroll down to beds using =, or simply hit b.
- 你能够按=键向下滚动到床，或者可以简单的按b键
- The menu now changes back to the q list and you’ll see Construct bed listed. But we want more than one bed!
- 现在菜单又变回了按q键以后的样子，你会看到构建床已经存在在列表上了。但是我们需要不止一张床
- Hit a again, and then b. Repeat until we’ve got five beds up there. We don’t need a bed for every dwarf just yet, luckily for us they seem happy to sleep in shifts.
- 再一次按a键然后按b键，重复这个动作直到你得到五张床。我们现在不需要为每一个矮人准备一张床，看起来他们对于轮流睡一张床这件事也感到很开心

Your carpentry workshop menu should now look like this:

你现在的木工工坊菜单看起来应该和这个类似：

![../_images/02-carpenter-menu.png](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/02-carpenter-menu.png)

If your workshop menu looks like this, well done! Five beds are queued up and hitting Esc a couple of times will un-pause the game and set a dwarf working, building your beds. You may have noted that there are a lot of other workshop options available to us now we have items on the build list. We can s suspend any construction, set any item to be r, repeat built, or we can hit c and cancel the construction of the current listed item. We can also have the entire workshop removed using x. For now, lets just watch the beds get built!

如果你的工坊菜单看起来和这个类似，那么你做得很好！五张床已经存在在队列中，按几次ESC键让你的游戏恢复运行，你的小矮人就会行动起来制作这些床。现在你可能已经注意到了在工坊菜单中有很多其他的选项供我们使用，我们可以暂停任何建造，将物品用r键设置重复建造，或者我们可以按c键取消目前列表上的建造。我们还可以使用x键来移除整个工坊。现在，我们就好好等着这些床被建好吧。

Note, you won’t see the beds being put anywhere. Want to know why? The answer is simple, and if you’re extra-special clever you may have already worked it out: We have no furniture stockpile! Lets fix that:

你会看到床被放置得到处都是，想知道为什么吗？答案很简单，或许聪明的你已经猜到了：我们没有家具仓库！让我们来修复这个问题：

- Hit p from the main menu.
- 在主菜单中按p键
- hit u for Furniture Storage.
- 按u键选择家具仓库
- Move the X near the workshop, hit Enter, and designate a pile about 5 tiles by 5 tiles.
- 在工坊附近移动X标记，按回车键，划出大约5X5的仓库区域

Here’s my pile after a few seconds of the game resumed:

这是游戏恢复运行几秒钟之后我仓库的样子：

![../_images/02-pile-furniture.png](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/02-pile-furniture.png)

You’ll note the dwarfs have moved the constructed beds to the pile as well as some spare barrels, our anvil and a bag. As stated above, we don’t usually like to leave our stuff lying around outside, even in tidy piles, but as a temporary solution it helps keep things organised and gets the furniture moved from the workshop. If items aren’t pulled out from under the carpenter’s feet then eventually the workshop will get cluttered (marked with [CLT] when you q over the workshop) and a cluttered workshop works slower.

你会注意到我们的矮人已经把建好的床，一些备用的桶，我们的铁砧和一个袋子移动到了仓库中。就像我们之前所说的，我们通常不会把我们东西留在外面，即使是一小片仓库，但目前作为临时解决方案的室外仓库能够保持我们的东西都井然有序，能够让矮人们把工坊中的家具都移动到仓库中。如果物品没有从木匠的脚下拿走，最终这个工坊会变得杂乱不堪（在按q键查看工坊状态时以CLT标记），一个杂乱的工坊其工作效率会下降。

Later on we can remove piles by using p and then x and selecting the whole area of the stockpile. What’s better is that helpful dwarfs will grab those items and move them to another suitable pile. But enough of that, lets get on with building our fortress!

之后我们会通过按p键，然后按x键，然后选中整个仓库区域来移除这个仓库，你的矮人会把原来仓库里的东西转移到其他合适的仓库中。但现在来说这已经够用了。让我们继续建造我们的要塞吧

## 2.3. Digging down, down, down!

## 2.3 向下，向下，再向下！

What kind of Dwarfs would we be if we only scratched around on the top of this mound like dirty hobbits? We want to dig down, down, down! The easiest way of doing this is to build some stairs. Well, to be precise, we’re going to designate some stairs using the d menu. We are going to designate some un-dug space to be stairs and then see what’s going on a few metres down. So follow along, and lets get expanding!

如果我们像那些肮脏的霍比特人一样永远蜗居在地表第一层，那我们算什么矮人！矮人的奥义就是向下向下再向下！实现这个最容易的办法就是建造一些楼梯，准确来说，我们要使用d菜单来规划出一些向下挖掘的区域，然后看看下面有些什么。

- Move the map to the top side of our corridor.
- 将地图视角移动到走廊入口
- Hit d and then j for downward stairway.
- 按d键然后按j键来建造向下的楼梯
- Move the X into the black and hit enter, move the cursor down one, and hit enter again.
- 移动X标记到黑色的地方然后按回车，向下移动一格光标，然后再次按回车

You should see six downwards stairs marked. You may be wondering why I have set six stairs down. The reason is that dwarfs need space to move past each other. If the corridor, or stairs, are only 1 wide, then they have to pause to let each other pass. This slows movement around your fortress down terribly once you have dozens of dwarfs running around. Six stairs will be plenty for a long time.

你可以看到已经标记好了6个向下的楼梯。你可能会想知道为什么有六个向下的楼梯。这里的原因在于矮人们需要空间让彼此通过。如果走廊或者楼梯只有一的宽度，那么他们就必须停下来让彼此通过。一旦你拥有了很多矮人之后，这样的现象将会严重的降低你的要塞的运行效率。六个楼梯在很长一段时间内都是足够的。

Hit space until the game is running and let that area get built. It should look something like this when it’s done:

按空格键直到游戏恢复运行并等待

![../_images/02-stairs-down.png](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/02-stairs-down.png)

Super! A hallway and two downward staircases! At this point you may be feeling pretty chuffed with yourself. But if you go down a level (>, you’ll recall) you’ll not see any stairs going up, or much of anything, just these tan blobs:

干得好！现在我们拥有了一个走廊和两个向下的楼梯！你可以为你现在所得到的成就感到骄傲了。但是如果你往下一个水平看看（回忆一下，按>键），你看不到任何向上的楼梯，或者其他任何东西，只有这些棕色带斑点的方块：

![../_images/02-stairs-lower.png](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/02-stairs-lower.png)

Where are our stairs going up? Where are our vast stores of mineral wealth? Well, this is where stairs get crazy-strange. Let me explain…

我们向上的楼梯去哪儿了？我们地下数不清的矿藏宝石哪去了？恩，这就是楼梯变得很奇怪的原因，让我解释给你听

To dwarves a down stair is just an exploratory stair dug down to see what’s on the level below. It’s like knocking a hole in the floor so you can look down on your neighbours in the flat below, hoping perhaps to work out what the weird noises are.

对于矮人来说，一个向下的楼梯只是一个带有探索目的的窗口，他们向下挖一点，看看下一个水平面有些什么。这就像是你在你的地板上敲个洞，想弄清楚一些奇怪的声音是从哪儿来的

To actually go down to the level below, you need to build stairs going up from the level you’re digging to. Or in our case, we want to build an Up/Down Stairway as we are looking to dig down a long, long way. An Up/Down stairway pokes the proverbial holes in both directions. It links up with a stairway above (if there’s one there) and tries to link up with a stairway below (if there’s one there). If there’s no stairway to link up with it will provide access to those other levels so you can build the needed stairs.

要实现向下走的目标，你需要在你挖掘到达的那一层建造向上走的楼梯。在我们这个情况中，我们想要建造一个向上/向下楼梯，因为我们会一直向下挖掘很深的路。这种向上/向下楼梯提供了上下两个方向的连接可能性：如果它的上一层或下一层有楼梯，那么它就会和他们自动连接。如果没有，那么它就会生成一个楼梯接口，以供你之后建造楼梯时使用

Here’s a handy side-on diagram:

这是一份简单的示意图

![../_images/stairs-diagram.png](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/stairs-diagram.png)

译者的理解：如果你想到达下一层，你只需要一个向下的楼梯，如果你想到达上一层，你则需要一个向上的楼梯，或者使用向上/向下楼梯来使用同一个通道同时实现这两个目的，但此时，一个通道同一时间只是实现一个方向的运动，这意味着如果有人正在楼梯上向下走，但底下的人想上楼的话，必须等这个楼梯处于无人使用的状态。

To build an up/down stairway, do this:

跟随以下步骤来建造一个向上向下楼梯：

- Go down one level from our main area.
- 从我们的主区域中向下一层
- At this level, below our down stairs, hit d, i to designate an Up/Down Stairway.
- 在这一层，在我们的楼梯下方，按d键，再按i键来规划向上向下楼梯
- Move the X over the tan blocks. Hit Enter, move down one level, and hit Enter again.
- 移动X标记覆盖棕色方块，按回车，移动到下一层，再按一次回车键
- Brown X’s now show that your up-down stairway has been designated.
- 棕色的X标记意味着你的向上向下楼梯已经被规划好了
- If you mess it up, d and then x can un-designate the space for you.
- 如果你中间有什么搞砸了，你能按d键然后按x来取消之前的规划
- Resume the game and the up/down stairs will be dug. The designation looks like this:
- 恢复游戏运行，你的楼梯将会被建造。你现在的规划看起来和这个类似：

![../_images/02-stairs-updown.png](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/02-stairs-updown.png)

Lovely! Perfect up-down stairs. But we’re not done yet.



So far you’ve been selecting two corners to designate a rectangle in two dimensions - but laying out a staircase would get pretty tedious like that! Luckily DF supports three-dimensional designations as well, so lay it out in 2D, then > to level 103 to finish the column.

Rock! We’ve got some rock around us! This is the sort of place a good dwarf loves! How about we dig out some of this space? I suggest a set of square rooms just off the staircase, with two tile wide doorways. It’s a simple layout, but enough for now. See if you can match mine.

![../_images/02-rooms-large.png](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/02-rooms-large.png)

Now let your boys dig! Dig boys, dig! And make sure all your areas set to be dug connect back to your stairs!

Along the way you may get various messages about striking various ores. That’s good news! Metal is very handy, as you can imagine. But we’ll worry about metal later.

## 2.4. What’s that on the ground?

While they’re busy digging, why not have a look at what is scattered all over the ground. To do that, from the main menu, hit k to look around. An X will appear and you can direct it using the arrow keys. As you move it around you’ll see what’s under the arrow. Check my example:

![../_images/02-look-around.png](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/02-look-around.png)

As you can see, underneath my X is a dwarf, some limestone, and a limestone cavern floor. I can use = to scroll down through those three items, and hitting Enter will display me some info about each. Ok, except for the floor. I mean, what do you want to know? It’s a floor!

Look around is a very handy way to see what is in a square. Sometimes items get stacked a few deep and you’re not sure what is what, k will show you. Also, it is very handy way to find out what the walls and ground are made of. For example, without irrigation you won’t be able to build a farm plot inside on anything but soil, sand, silt, clay or loam. Look around will show you what the ground is made of.

Toy with k for a while, and see what minerals are being dug up. Then lets leave the dwarfs digging, we’ve got a very important job to do…

## 2.5. Chucking out the trash!

By now, believe it or not, some rubbish may be building up in your fortress. I’ve taken a shot of some rubbish near our food pile. Have a look at those slimy bones in with the barrels of booze:

![../_images/02-food-trash.png](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/02-food-trash.png)

Using k I can have a closer look and see exactly what this trash is… Rat remains. Yuck! We can’t have this left lying around our tidy fortress, can we? Well, we could, but the end result would be a stinking cloud of purple miasma. Miasma makes our dwarfs unhappy. While they may never shower and probably reek to high-heaven, they really don’t like the smell of rotting leftovers. Go figure.

So how do we get rid of the refuse? Easy! We build p Stockpiles for r Refuse. But note, we need to build this pile outside or we’ll get miasma build-up. Outside, the wind blows the stink away.

See if you can set up a refuse pile on your own like mine. It’s just like making any other pile, except we set r for refuse as we plot it.

![../_images/02-pile-refuse.png](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/02-pile-refuse.png)

Look, some of the refuse has already been moved! Phew, miasma criss averted!

But we still have one really, really important job to do…

## 2.6. Making booze!

Booze is the lifeblood of dwarven society. Literally so. Dwarfs, unless injured, will prefer to drink booze over water 100% of the time. If there is no booze, they will drink water, and that’s terrible - they work slower, and are more prone to murderous tantrums.

So what do we do about the dwarf booze demands? Simple! We build a still!

Follow along, dear reader:

- Hit b for Build.
- Hit w for Workshops.
- Hit l for Still, or scroll through and find the still yourself, and hit enter.
- Place the still in the room above the food stockpile, like this.

![../_images/02-still-place.png](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/02-still-place.png)

Placing it near food makes sense, as it will turn food items into booze. The less walking for our brewer, the better. Once you’ve placed it and selected the materials (any will do), your still should be quickly built and look something like this:

![../_images/02-still-built.png](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/02-still-built.png)

Before we brew some booze, there’s one more thing we need: barrels.

- Head to the carpenter.
- Hit q.
- Hit a.
- Scroll down to Make wooden Barrel, or just hit v.
- Fill the queue with barrels.

Now to make it start churning out the brewskies!

- Hit q and move the cursor to the still.
- Hit a for Add new task.
- Hit b for Brew drink from plant
- Hit a and b another 7 or so times.

Yay! You have now queued up a lot of beer to be made.

To keep booze production at an acceptable rate, there’s a couple of options. One is to keep checking manually, but you only have to be late once to cause a tantrum! The second is to set up repeating jobs (q, select job, r), but then it’s easy for production of drinks and barrels to get out of sync and waste valuable materials.

The third option is a plugin called `workflow`, which lets you set a target amount and will suspend and unsuspend production jobs to keep you at that level. q, select job, Alt-w, A to Add limit, R adjust the range. This might seem complicated, but setting 50-100 drinks and 10-20 barrels will keep things flowing smoothly until your population is a lot larger.

End result, happy dwarfs! An important thing to note at this point is that brewing alcohol uses plants, but doesn’t destroy the seeds. Cooking does destroy the seeds of any plant cooked, which can seriously compromise your ability to grow more food! So for now, lets just stick to making some extra booze. We should be ok for food for a while yet with our farm running, since dwarves love raw mushrooms.

Time to head back down stairs to see how our miners are going. Let them dig at least one room out before continuing with the next step. Hopefully they’re not sleeping on the job (The big Z flashing on them)!

## 2.7. The World of Doors!

We need doors. Lots of doors. We need beds, doors, chairs, tables. We need lots of them. If you’re starting to feel like an Ikea salesman, don’t worry, when you see a bed menacing with spikes of cat leather, engraved with an image of a dwarf striking down a goblin with other dwarfs laughing, then you’ll know you’re no longer in Sweden. So how are we going to get all of this wonderful furniture?

Well, we could build some doors and assorted other stuff in our carpenters’ workshop. But that would use valuable wood. Much better would be to use all that stone you can see strewn about. So how do we do that? I’m glad you asked! We build a masons workshop. Here’s how:

- Hit b for Build.
- w for Workshops.
- m for Masons Workshop.

Chose an area near our main stairs up, in one of our new rooms. You can check the shot below to see where I’m going to place mine.

![../_images/02-mason-where.png](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/02-mason-where.png)

- Select some stone and get the thing built!

Once it’s up it’s time to get it producing some useful items:

- q over the Mason’s Workshop.
- a for Add new task, then d for door. Do this four times.
- a for add task, then t for table, do this twice.
- a for add task, then c for chair, do this twice. Note that in DF, a chair made from stone is called a throne. They’re not the only thing to have different names depending on the material, so if in doubt check the wiki.

Wee! Look at all that lovely furniture queued up! Soon our mason will turn up and start cutting blocks of stone into something more useful. Unfortunately, someone is going to end up trying to haul all that furniture up stairs to the furniture stockpile, and we can’t have that, so lets make a big stockpile in the middle of this room.

While you’re at it, why not remove the furniture stockpile upstairs and get all of that stuff out of the rain. Go up to the pile, hit p for pile, then x and then hit Enter at one corner of the outdoors furniture stockpile, and then move the cursor to the other end and hit Enter again. Here’s my downstairs stockpile, complete with some just-moved furniture and a mason hard at work!

![../_images/02-mason-use.png](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/02-mason-use.png)

Now it’s time to get those doors and beds into use, and when the tables and chairs are built, we’ll use those too!

## 2.8. Home Sweet Home

You may have noticed that our dwarfs have been sleeping on the ground when they get tired. This is really not much fun for them and we’d like to give them a place to stay. With some beds built, lets set up a big bedroom on the top floor so our dwarfs can get some shuteye.

- Head to the top floor, and dig out a small room at the end of the hallway.
- Hit b and then b again (for Bed).
- Move the cursor and place a bed in the corner (hit enter, select a bed and hit enter again).
- Spread the five beds around the room.
- Hit Esc until we’re back at the main menu.
- Hit b again, and d for Door.
- Place doors across the room entrance.

Here’s my room layout. The shadowy beds and door show that the beds and doors aren’t placed yet. The green X shows me about to place the next door.

![../_images/02-beds-shadows.png](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/02-beds-shadows.png)

Pretty soon the room will be laid out and we’ll be ready to use it to house our little workers. Here’s mine finished, doesn’t it look pretty?

![../_images/02-beds-built.png](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/02-beds-built.png)

But the dwarfs won’t use it as a bedroom yet. We have to specify what the room is to be used for first. To do this:

- Hit q.
- Move the cursor near one of the beds. It will start flashing green.
- On the right, you’ll see the option r Make Bedroom.
- Hit r.
- You will now see a flashing blue square. Here’s mine, as selected from the bottom-left bed.

![../_images/02-beds-room.png](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/02-beds-room.png)

We could hit enter now and set the room at this size, but that would leave two beds out. So we need to make the room size bigger. With the blue square flashing…

- Hit = and this will make the blue square bigger until it fills the whole room.

You will note that the room won’t “leak” beyond the boundaries of the walls and doors. This is why we need doors, to prevent leaky rooms! Makes sense? Right? Ok… moving on…

- Hit Enter with the room set at max size, a new menu will appear on the right.

This menu gives you options for the room. It will always appear when you q over the item you set a room’s use from. Note, you don’t have to set every bed in the room as a bedroom (although the game will let you do that). DF is smart enough to know that the room is a bedroom, and all the beds in the room should be used.

On the new menu you want to:

- Hit d for Dormitory, this will turn the (N) to a (Y).

With the room set as a dormitory any dwarf without their own room will use the beds in the dormitory to sleep in. When you have a military, a Barracks is where dwarfs will spar and sleep when off duty.

Well done! We have a shared bedroom for our shorties to sleep in!

In [the next chapter of the walkthrough](https://df-walkthrough.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chapters/chap03-recap-home.html#chapter03), we’ll build a fine dining room, set up some more workshops, and start to build some proper living quarters for our dwarves. I can’t wait!
